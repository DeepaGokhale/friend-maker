# friend-maker

Frineds maker App has some mock data with current friends you can find a match for

Simply answer the questions and see who is a perfect match for you.

It validates your choices to make sure you have all the information but at this point it does not save it to the database.

**I have tried my best to work with alert and modal but I could not get the modal to not work when the validation does not go through. That is the work in progress
 Another thing that I could not do was validate the link to the picture .That would be for future

 Initially I made random survey ansers for mock data each time the site was running but then I cahnged it for fun! That code is also commented in the friend.js for your reference (that was more of the practice for some logic and random algorythm)

 **Please note that I have updated the portfolio
